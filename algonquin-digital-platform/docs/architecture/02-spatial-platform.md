# Spatial Platform

Spatial support is a shared capability, not a single application. Every ecosystem
may attach spatial context using the same versioned contract while keeping its own
domain behavior and access controls.

## Domain uses

| Ecosystem | Spatial use |
|---|---|
| AC Cloud | Place/scene identity lookup, access policy, indexing, and events |
| ACF | Hardware locality, topology, scheduling zones, and data locality |
| AC AI | Campus graph, place-aware assistance, spatial reasoning, and agents |
| AC Media Fabric | Captures, cameras, poses, scenes, 3D assets, and 4DGS |
| AC Fediverse | Place-aware communities, events, media, and federated objects |

## Privacy defaults

- Precise location is private unless an explicit policy and user action allow it.
- Public/federated objects use reduced precision or a public place identifier.
- Every spatial assertion records source, precision, time, confidence, and
  retention classification.
- Systems exchange identifiers and contract-shaped metadata, not unrestricted
  location histories.
